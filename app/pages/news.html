                      <p>
                        German ex-finance minister Wolfgang Sch채uble, who helped steer the eurozone through the debt
                        crisis, has died at the age
                        of 81.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        An MP for 51 years in Germany's Bundestag, he played a key role in negotiating German
                        reunification after the fall of
                        the Berlin Wall in 1989.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He then survived an attempt on his life by a mentally unstable gunman.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And although never chancellor, Sch채uble was widely viewed as one of Germany's most influential
                        post-war politicians.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Beyond Germany, he became a hate figure for many Greeks during the eurozone debt crisis, as
                        architect of a highly
                        unpopular austerity programme imposed on their country.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Wolfgang Sch채uble joined the conservative CDU party in 1965 and entered the Bundestag seven
                        years later when he was 30.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As interior minister of West Germany, he co-signed the treaty in East Berlin that unified the
                        country in August 1990. He
                        later called reunification "the high point of my political life".
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Nine days after Germany was formally reunited, he was shot in the spinal cord and jaw during an
                        election campaign event
                        and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He returned to the public stage months later with an impassioned call for the reunified
                        country's capital to be moved
                        from Bonn to Berlin.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        He went on to lead the CDU in 1998, until Angela Merkel took over in 2000 in the middle of a
                        party donations scandal.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        On becoming Germany's chancellor in 2005, she appointed him first as interior minister then
                        later as finance minister,
                        where he spent eight years focused on balancing the German budget.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He achieved Germany's so-called schwarze Null or black zero budget deficit in 2014 and he was
                        widely viewed as the
                        driving force behind the austerity policies adopted by the eurozone in response to the debt
                        crisis that began in 2008.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "Greece's debt crisis and the crises it generated offer a clear warning to European policymakers
                        not to allow public
                        debt to pile up indefinitely," he told the European Parliament in 2011.
